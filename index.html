        <p>Welcome to Minesweeper!</p>
        <p>There are mines hidden throughout the board. If you click on a mine, it will explode, and that's game over.</p>
        <p>Your goal is to uncover all the "safe" fields. Once all the fields without bombs have been uncovered, you win the game.</p>
        <p>
          Left-click on the field will open/uncover the field, right-click will flag the field. You can use the flag if you suspect there is a bomb on
          a particular field.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a field has adjacent bombs (immediate neighbor cells in all directions), you will see a number. The number tells you exactly how many
          adjacent cells are bombs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you click on a blank/safe field without adjacent bombs, it will uncover all continuous safe fields, until it reaches cells that have
          adjacent bombs.
        </p>
        <p>
